            <br>
          <p>As a software engineer, I enjoy coding in itself. It brings me joy because of its
            constant growth, which challenges me to keep learning. The paths in computer science are immense.
            Web development and data science are two areas I find the most interest and passion.
            <br>
            <br>
            As an actor and filmmaker, I enjoy the art in telling stories. Nothing excites me more than
            collaborating with others to put together a meaningful story that showcases the skill of 
            adopting characters. Writing is a big part of this passion as well, and has helped me hone my skills
            as an actor.

              <p style='font-size:2rem'> There are so many ways to solve problems, design,
                       and bring your ideas to life by through coding. 
                       I think what really attracts me is the freedom in the practice. 
                       I love to be able to think freely, create, and find ways to do things differently 
                       and effectively.</p>
              <br>
              <p style ='font-size:2rem'> When creating something I find there is usually some kind of struggle, roadblock,
              or something that gets in your way. Whether it be your own project or something you are contributing to,
            it doesn't matter. What matters is that you were able to get passed it and find a way to the solution. It doesn't
            have to deal with the functionality aspect, but it can also be apart of design, security, or anything important to the idea.
           Whatever the case may be you were able to get passed the roadblock, and that is something I live for in coding. </p>

                      I feel like the same type of creativity applies to acting. There is not a 
                      certain way to play a character. Given a scene and circumstances, it is 
                      how you believe it should be portrayed. There can be multiple ways.<br> <br> 
                      Of course, certain ways to play a character can be better than others, but that is apart of
                      being creative. How can you seperate yourself, what are the details that might give you an edge
                      in your performance rather than someone else of the same character. Although I love to look for
                      competition in this way, I believe that the joy comes from learning and adopting the character to tell a story,
                      send a message, and put on a performance anyone would believe. That is something I live for in acting.

        <div class ='col-sm-12'>
          <h1> INT./EXT. Why Computer Science? Why Acting? </h1>
                    <p> If I were to be short about it, I think it's because I love to code and I love to act. 
                      But, there is so much within that love. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> I love to act because I get a release from it. 
                      Nothing beats the goosebumps you get when you do something that shocks even yourself. 
                      Having a process is key. Everyone is different, but really digging deep into a character, 
                      and creating a past for them is something I find helpful. I truly enjoy the creation of the character
                      and the process leading up to the performance because that is what makes the performance. 
                      A lot of it is about just <i>doing</i> not acting. </p> 
                    <br>

                    <p> I love to code because of nearly the same thing, but in a different form. 
                      It's still got a process similar to acting, but it feels quicker to me. 
                      Preparing and understanding a problem, then being able to apply it in projects, 
                      algorithms, etc. It is fulfilling not only because you solved the problem, but because 
                      you have another solution under your belt, a weapon in your arsenal. 
                      
                      <br><br> You can constantly grow, and that's what both 
                      coding and acting are about. The constant want to grow, learn, and accomplish. It's
                       something that keeps you moving.</p>
