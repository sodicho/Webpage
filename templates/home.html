	<center><p> Hello, and welcome to the final product of the newly founded website. I have made this website in order to provide sufficiency to the computer science world. My goal is to become the first website to ever get 1,000,000 hits without marketing it ever. That sentence is a lie. What I really want is to figure out the best route for myself. Surround myself with the best people possible in order to achieve the goals I strive for. Which are: 1. To become an actor or 2. Become the most successful computer scientist I can be. I love acting because the creativity, and adrenaline you get from performing. It lets you move freely, do things to mimic emotion in ways humans subconsciously do but can't re-create flawlessly. It is truly an art, and my passion. I love computer science because of the creativity and innovative aspect. It's so free, and different in so many different ways. Different ways to reach the same goal. Different languages. The curiousity brings you to a place where you can find something new. A platform for social media, a robot, an AI, and so on. It is truly the future and I think it can be used for the betterment of life in so many ways. So I find myself in this, <i>bind</i>, for a lack of better terms. Which route do I take. Coming from a not as financially stable life, do I risk it right away and pursue what I believe to be my greatest passion in acting? Or do I play it a safer route. Move into the field of software development, which I do love as well, make the money that I need to self support, and climb the mountain of acting. The reason I have this bind is because of the fact that I can't simply do both. Realistically, Acting is a job that works all throughout the day and week, especially if you have an important role. A job as a software developer is a 9-5 job throughout the week. So these two interfere. I may not be entirely right about not being able to balance the two. But, I know it won't be in my best interest to juggle the two. So what will it be.. Acting, or Computer Science.   </p></center>
