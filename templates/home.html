					<h1> INT. CODING IS CREATIVITY </h1>
                    <p style='font-size:2rem'> There are so many ways to solve problems, design, and bring your ideas to life by just simply coding. I think what really attracts me is the freedom in the practice. I love to be able think freely, create, find ways to do things differently and effectively.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p style ='font-size:2rem'> Sounds like it's simple, but if you've never done it and you lay your eyes on something like the picture above, it can be a bit intimidating.</p>

                    <p style='font-size:2rem'> Just like there is a certain creativity to coding, I feel like the same type of creativity applies to acting. There is not a certain way to play a character. Given a scene and circumstances, it is how you believe it should be portrayed. There can be multiple ways.<br> <br> Of course, certain ways to play a character can be better than others, and I feel like that directly relates to coding. You can solve a problem two different ways, but one way might take less space and be quicker. Playing a character could be done in two ways, and one of the portrayals could be more appealing than the other.  </p>

          <h1> INT./EXT. Why Computer Science? Why Acting? </h1>
                    <p style='font-size:2rem'> If I were to be short about it, I think it's because I love to code and I love to act. But, there is so much within that love. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p style ='font-size:2rem'> I love to act because I kind of get a high off of it, or a release if you will. Nothing beats the goosebumps you get when you do something that shocks even yourself. Having a process is key. Everyone is different, but really digging deep into a character, and creating a past for them is something I find helpful. A lot of it is about just <i>doing</i> not acting. It's not easy to explain, but it is a beautiful feeling. </p> 
                    <br>

                    <p style ='font-size:2rem'> I love to code because of nearly the same thing, but in a different form. It's still got a process similar to acting, but it feels quicker to me. Preparing and understanding a problem, then being able to apply it in projects, algorithms, etc. It is fulfilling not only because you solved the problem, but because you have another solution under your belt. As you begin to build up your arsenal of skills, you feel like you can take on anything. <br><br>You can constantly grow, and that's what, both computer science and acting, are about. The constant want to grow, learn, accomplish. It's something that keeps you moving.</p>
